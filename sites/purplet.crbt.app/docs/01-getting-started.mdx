# Getting Started

TODO: Purplet install explanation

import InstallCodeBlock from '@site/src/components/InstallCodeBlock';

<InstallCodeBlock />

## Scripts

- **`purplet dev`**: Starts a bot in development mode. Allows live-reloading. Deploys application
  commands only to specified servers to ensure they are instantly usable.
- **`purplet build`**: Builds a compiled `.js` file with the bot, running application commands
  globally.

## Project Structure

- **`.env`**: Git-ignored file with environment variables, including bot and database tokens.
- **`purplet.config.ts`**: Contains project configuration.
- **`.purplet/`**: Contains generated files by purplet
- **`src/features/`**: Every `.js`/`.ts` file in this folder will be automatically scanned and
  loaded for Features.
- **`src/lib/`**: Contains reusable code for your bot, importable by `$lib`. Not loaded
  automatically like the features folder is.
