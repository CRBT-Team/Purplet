## Purplet

Purplet is a discord framework where your bot features are defined in small modules that can be reloaded instantly. Iterate your ideas faster than ever with the combined powers of [TypeScript][1] and [Vite][2].

> ⚠️ Purplet v2 is a rewrite of the framework. Most features from [v1][v1] have not yet been ported, and only the core basics function. Proceed with caution.
