# Purplet Starter Project

And voil√†! Your new Purplet bot is now ready to go.

Your commands and other Purplet modules are in the `/src/modules` directory. Your Purplet configuration is located in `/purplet.config.js`. Make sure to set your bot's token in `.env` before running the bot.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

And once everything is set up, you can start the bot in dev mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To create a production version of your bot, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
