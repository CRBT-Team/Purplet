# Mention Commands

Mention commands. Since they are triggered by `@` mentions of the bot, the [Message Intent](#) is not required to use these.

Mentioning the bot without any other text will display a generated help menu.

:::warning

Consider using [Slash Commands](/docs/slash-commands) instead of these, as it provides better discoverability to users. These still make sense in the context of debugging.
